The page must be done as close as posible to a layout given and must show specific user-experience characteristics (you can check more info about the challenge <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6'>here</a>). </p> <p class='project__properties-desc p-l-md-20px'> For the layout, two presentations are indicated: One for desktops and laptops and a second for smartphones. Tablets and similar devices are not taken into account. </p> <p class='project__properties-desc p-l-md-20px'> The presentations share some settings: A header and a main content section, without a footer. The header (for the desktop layout) includes a logo, a non-functional navigation bar, a shopping cart component and a icon image where it is simulated an user avatar. The links in the navigation bar and the image icon have 'hover' effects and the shopping cart has some functions. In the mobile desktop, the header only displays the logo, the shopping cart icon and the fake user avatar icon. The navigation bar has a style similar to the components known as 'off-canvas', where the link list is hidden off-screen and a so-called 'burger' button is used to expose and to hide the navigation menu.</p> <p class='project__properties-desc p-l-md-20px'>The main content it's divided into two subsections. A gallery with some pictures of the product (located at the left in the desktop-view and first shown at the mobile-view) and a box with the product-related information (located at the right of the desktop-view and shown after the gallery at the mobile-view).  Meanwhile the product information box has almost the same layout in both cases, the gallery has a different work in each presentation. For desktops, the gallery is composed of two parts: One where there is a large, clickable picture that opens a so-called 'light gallery' - apart from the page - and a set of thumbnails capable of changing the large image when clicked. The mobile view only shows the pictures of the 'light gallery' as a carousel where a pair of buttons are used to change the current image. </p> <p class='project__properties-desc p-l-md-20px'> As indicated in the challenge page, it's requested to create the product page with specific functionalities, which are listed below: </p> <ul> <li>See the appropiate 'hover' states for the indicated interactive elements on the page</li> <li>The lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image</li> <li>Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images</li> <li>Add items to the cart</li> <li>View the cart and remove items from it</li> </ul>",
